idea for this library partly based on oryginal wemos code from:<br>
https://github.com/wemos/WEMOS_Matrix_LED_Shield_Arduino_Library<br>
with a few mods and additions like scroll, letters, icons, display flip and improvements of speed.

Some parts of code is based on solutions from websites.

Lib still under development (maybe forever), please comment out #define MATRIXDEBUG for normal usage
